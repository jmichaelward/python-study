# Python Learning
Back before I became I full-time web developer who worked in the 
WordPress agency space, I was a student at my local community college.
As part of my program, we touched several different programming 
languages: PHP, JavaScript, C++, Java.

Python was the first language we used as part of a two-part Data 
Structures class. It was chosen because of its general accessibility
and ease of use. Our textbook was [Python Programming: An Introduction
to Computer Science, 2nd Edition](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/ppics2/index.html) 
by John Zelle, which was written specifically for the classroom.

Before I'd taken any classes about computer programming, my sole experience
doing anything code-related was developing static websites for the bands
I played in using HTML and CSS. I enjoyed tinkering on the web, but it wasn't until
I started learning the fundamentals of programming that I realized that it was what I wanted
to do every day.

During my last semester of college, I began an internship at a local web development agency
which specialized in WordPress. I've remained in the WordPress agency ecosystem since that time. 
Now, though, I want to get back to my programming roots, to do a deeper dive into other languages,
other structures, other ways of working both on and off the web. What better way to get re-immersed
into that way of thinking than getting started with the first language that got me here?

This repository is a playground, merely a way for me to generate small files written in Python to
re-acclimate myself to its fundamentals. There is a lot for me to learn - in fact, it may not even be
possible for you to do download and install this to run these small modules on your own, as it's not even
clear to me yet at this point what should be version controlled and what should not. That said, 
if you'd like to follow along, here are a few resources I'm using as part of my journey.

### Resources
- The aforementioned book by John Zelle. At the time of this writing, the book is 10 years old, and there is a more
recent third edition available. That said, thankfully the examples in the 2nd edition copy were written using Python 3,
so I suspect many of those examples will still be valid. That said, I'll need to explore other resources, as well,
to ensure that the concepts I'm learning are as current as possible.
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). This book and website used to be free, and I'm glad to
see that that is no longer the case. That said, I'm going to start with the free examples and decide whether the information
there is enough to keep me pushing forward with the language. If so, I plan to purchase the full book to support the 
author who graciously has kept this site online all these years.
- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/). The primary site for the language.

Those three should be enough to get me started, though I am of course open to hearing about other resources as well,
if you happen to be reading this random README on the web and have recommendations! Feel free to visit my website
