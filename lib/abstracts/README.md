# Abstract classes
During my course of study and investigation into the ins and outs of Python,
I've come to learn that Python does not have single-inheritance like PHP, and
that there is in fact no such thing as an interface, at least in the way 
that PHP defines them.

Class inheritance is quite a bit different in Python. I'm creating this
temporary directory to explore the concept of abstract classes, and to 
gain a better understanding of how the inheritance structure works.
